total number of rocks = 1_000_000_000_000
minus the first 1154 rocks = 999_999_998_846
amount of cycles (/1695) in 999_999_998_846 = 589_970_500 with remaining 1346 rocks
(1346+1154) + 1 rock height = 3884

total height = 1804 + (589_970_500 * 2634) + (3884 - 1804) = (589_970_500 * 2634) + 3884 = 1553982297000 + 3884
= 1553982300884

1154th rock has height of 1804
2849th rock has height of 4438
every cycle of 1695 rock has height of 2634 (starting from 1154)
